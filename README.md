# Solar-Simulator-Calibration-for-Tandem-I-V
A jupyter notebook enabling virtual calibration for solar simulators according to IEC 60904-1-1, for tandem I-V measurements. This code was written by Antoine Bourgeois, Stella Hadiwidjaja, and Zoltan Nicot-Senneville. 

Before running the code, the user requires:
- Spectral responses of reference cells and device-under-test.
- Short-circuit of reference cells under reference spectrum.
- Characterization of each LED at control parameter intervals 0.1, 0.2, ...1.
